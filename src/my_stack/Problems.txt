Problems:

1)
Various signal towers are present in a city.
Towers are aligned in a straight horizontal line(from left to right) and
 each tower transmits a signal in the right to left direction.
 Tower A shall block the signal of Tower B if Tower A is present to the left of
 Tower B and Tower A is taller than Tower B. So,the range of a signal of a given
 tower can be defined as :

{(the number of contiguous towers just to the left of the given tower whose height
 is less than or equal to the height of the given tower) + 1}.

You need to find the range of each tower.
Example:
Input: 100 80 60 70 60 75 85
Output: 1 1 1 2 1 4 6

2)
Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']',
determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Note that an empty string is also considered valid.

Example 1:

Input: "()"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: "()[]{}"
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: "(]"
Output: false
Example 4:

Input: "([)]"
Output: false
Example 5:

Input: "{[]}"
Output: true

{
   "]" : "["
   "{" : "{"
   ""
}

5) Find out next Greater Element
Given an array, print the Next Greater Element (NGE) for every element.
 The Next greater Element for an element x is the first greater element on the right side of x in array.
 Elements for which no greater element exist, consider next greater element as -1.

Examples:

For any array, rightmost element always has next greater element as -1.
For an array which is sorted in decreasing order, all elements have next greater element as -1.
For the input array [4, 5, 2, 25}, the next greater elements for each element are as follows.
Element       NGE
   4      -->   5
   5      -->   25
   2      -->   25
   25     -->   -1

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-rectangle/description/
Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.
For example, given the following matrix:
1 0 1 0 0
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 0
Return 6.

10) Recursively remove all adjacent duplicates
Eg: 
Input: azxxzy
Output: ay
