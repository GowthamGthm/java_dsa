Example problems:
1) Merge Sort

2) Maximum Subarray Sum using Divide and Conquer algorithm
   You are given a one dimensional array that may contain both positive and negative integers,
   find the sum of contiguous subarray of numbers which has the largest sum.
   For example, if the given array is {-2, -5, 6, -2, -3, 1, 5, -6}, then the maximum subarray sum is 7
   (see highlighted elements).

3)  Get Minimum value in  rotated sorted array
/* A sorted array is rotated at some unknown point, find the minimum element in it.
Following solution assumes that all elements are distinct.
Examples
Input: {5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4}
Output: 1
Input: {1, 2, 3, 4}
Output: 1
Input: {1}
Output: 1
Input: {1, 2}
Output: 1
Input: {2, 1}
Output: 1
Input: {5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4}
Output: 1
Input: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
Output: 1
Input: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1}
Output: 1
Input:  {3, 4, 5, 1, 2}
Output: 1

4) Quicksort
