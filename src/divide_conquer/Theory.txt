        In a divide and conquer strategy :

        1.Problem is divided into parts;

        2.Each of these parts is attacked/solved independently,
        by applying the algorithm at hand
        (mostly recursion is used for this purpose) ;

        3.And then the solutions of each partition/division and
        combined/merged together to arrive at the final solution to
        the problem as a whole (this comes under conquer)

        Example, Quick sort, merge sort.


        1) Divide the original problem instance into a set of
        smaller sub-instances of itself;

        2) Independently solve each sub-instance;

        3) Combine smaller/independent sub-instance solutions to
        build a single solution for the larger/original instance]
