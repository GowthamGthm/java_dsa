Priority Queue:
Heap(Max Heap/Min Heap)

Applicatins:
    CPU Scheduling
    Load Balancing, Interupt Handling
	Data Compression
	Shortest Path Algorithm - DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHM
	Minimum Spanning Tree algorithms - Prim's algorithm
	HeapSort
	Artificial Intelligence : A* Search Algorithm :
	The A* search algorithm finds the shortest path between two vertices
	of a weighted graph, trying out the most promising routes first.
	The priority queue (also known as the fringe) is used to keep track
	of unexplored routes,
	the one for which a lower bound on the total path length
	is smallest is given highest priority.
